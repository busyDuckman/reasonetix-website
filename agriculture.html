  <h1>Digital Agriculture</h1>

<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>I was introduced to digital agriculture at CSIRO, where I lead teams performing various automated crop analysis tasks. This included hyperspectral imaging of crops, LiDAR scanning for biomass estimation, and helicopter based IR imaging of crops for comparing transpiration efficiency.</p>

<p>I have helped optimise agricultural operations using remote sensing, robotics and analytics, this included sensor based irrigation management, and working with semi-autonomous field robots. I’ve conducted on-site engineering in: PC2 research labs, automated greenhouses, and research farms. I have travelled to a wide range of institutions in Australia, Mexico & the USA to see best practices, and digital innovations, from a range of growers.</p>

<p>In 2018, a project I was managing received the CSIRO “Directors Award: Breakthrough Innovation”. For advancing the capabilities of a semi-autonomous field robot that performed LiDAR scanning of crops.</p>
