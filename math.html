  <h1>Mathematical Optimisation</h1>

<p>Maximize efficiency and reduce operational costs through strategic optimisation. I specialise in tailoring algorithms that solve complex placement, scheduling, and resource allocation problems—underpinned by a robust background in numerical methods and HPC.</p>

<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>I worked at the Australian National University, as a Research Fellow, where I was primarily tasked with applying optimisation techniques to difficult problems. During this time I became widely read in a variety of optimisation techniques and developed a variety of solutions for the projects I was assigned to.</p>

<h2>What I Offer</h2>
<p>I specialise in mathematical optimisation, developing efficient algorithms that solve complex scheduling, resource allocation, and computational problems. With expertise in Python, CUDA, and high-performance computing, I implement cutting-edge optimisation techniques that leverage parallel processing and probabilistic sampling to find optimal solutions quickly and reliably.</p>

<h3>Expertise in Optimisation Techniques</h3>
<p>I employ a range of mathematical optimisation methods tailored to real-world applications, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>LIPO (Lipschitz Optimisation)</strong> – A powerful approach for global optimisation when the objective function is expensive to evaluate. By efficiently exploring the search space, LIPO is particularly useful for hyperparameter tuning, scientific modelling, and AI-driven decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>Thompson Sampling & Bayesian Optimisation</strong> – Used when exploration and exploitation must be balanced.</li>
  <li><strong>Powell’s Method & Linear Descent Techniques</strong> – Applying gradient-free approaches to optimise functions where derivatives are unavailable or unreliable.</li>
  <li><strong>Gradient-Free Optimisation Methods</strong> – Implementing evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm optimisation, and simulated annealing where gradient-based approaches are impractical.</li>
  <li><strong>Classic Numerical Optimisation</strong> – Applying standard techniques to efficiently find local optima in well-behaved functions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I Don’t Do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Military applications</li>
  <li>Not all optimisation algorithms fall within my mathematical background.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who I Work With</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Research institutions and R&D teams</li>
  <li>Industrial and scientific software developers</li>
  <li>AI and data science teams in scientific domains</li>
  <li>Engineering and modelling specialists</li>
  <li>Agtech firms</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Deep expertise in mathematical modelling, probabilistic inference, and high-performance computing.</li>
  <li>Efficient use of GPU acceleration (CUDA) to reduce computational overhead in complex evaluation functions and scale optimisation workflows.</li>
  <li>Custom solutions tailored for industry-specific challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need efficient mathematical optimisation solutions that leverage state-of-the-art techniques let’s work together to build high-performance decision-making systems.</p>
