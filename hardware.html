  <h1>Hardware Prototyping</h1>

<p>Fast-track innovation with comprehensive hardware prototyping and fabrication services. I can help you design, build, and test functional prototypes, integrating sensors and microcontrollers for cutting-edge embedded systems.</p>

<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>I specialise in rapid hardware prototyping with a strong focus on sensor integration, data processing, and embedded systems. As a computer scientist, my expertise lies in working with digital systems, logic circuits, and real-time data acquisition. I bring a professional, hands-on approach to building functional prototypes that bridge hardware and software seamlessly.</p>

<h2>What I Offer</h2>

<h3>Custom Prototyping & Rapid Development</h3>
<p>I offer a rapid prototyping service that combines my skillsets in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PCB design</li>
  <li>Digital circuit design, and reverse engineering.</li>
  <li>CNC machining</li>
  <li>3D printing</li>
  <li>Metalwork & Welding</li>
  <li>Aluminium extrusion based construction</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sensor Integration & Embedded Systems</h3>
<p>I have extensive experience working with embedded systems that utilise a wide range of sensors, ensuring accurate data acquisition, processing, and real-time decision-making. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accelerometers and IMUs.</li>
  <li>Environmental monitoring and BMS</li>
  <li>Ultrasonic wind sensors and weather stations.</li>
  <li>Medical Sensors (EKG, GSR, BVP etc) and muscular data using sEMG</li>
  <li>Embedded systems programming (C++)</li>
  <li>Working with ESP, AVR, and ARM based systems</li>
  <li>SPI, I²C, UART, and CAN bus device integration</li>
</ul>

<h3>Digital Systems & Data Processing</h3>
<p>With a deep understanding of computational efficiency, real-time signal processing, and AI integration, I ensure that hardware systems are not just functional but intelligent and optimised. Key strengths include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>High-speed data processing and sensor fusion</li>
  <li>Embedded AI for real-time decision-making</li>
  <li>Wireless and IoT connectivity for remote monitoring</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I Don’t Do</h2>
<p>I am not an electrical engineer, nor do I specialise in analogue circuit design. While I can handle microcontrollers, and digital circuits, projects involving complex analogue systems, or high-voltage electronics are outside my wheelhouse.</p>

<h2>Who I Work With</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Researchers & Innovators looking to prototype novel sensing or automation systems.</li>
  <li>Startups & Engineers needing a functional proof-of-concept.</li>
  <li>Industrial & Scientific Clients requiring embedded AI and sensor-driven hardware.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>End-to-end prototyping – From concept to working prototype.</li>
  <li>Expertise in sensors & data – Making sure your hardware works intelligently and efficiently.</li>
  <li>Pragmatic & professional – Pulling together the right components to build something that works, without over-engineering.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need a fast, functional prototype that integrates sensors, embedded systems, and intelligent processing, let’s build it together.</p>
