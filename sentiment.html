  <h1>Affective Computing and Sentiment Analysis</h1>

<p><i>Transform client interactions, and social media data, into tangible insights on your reputation and branding.</i></p>

<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>I completed a PhD in Affective Computing and I am published in the field. Working with assessing people’s emotional response to your product or brand is a specialised field that requires a mix of expertise in: human psychology, data analysis and machine learning. Combining all this, I offer a specialised service in getting to know your clients and their relationship with your business.</p>

<p>Tap into specialised expertise in emotion assessment, built upon my doctoral research. I consult on affective computing projects. Whether it’s enhancing user engagement, monitoring health and well-being, or developing innovative interfaces that respond to emotional cues.</p>

<h2>Product Sentiment Discovery Package</h2>
<p>This package includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    User persona modelling workshop
    <ul>
      <li>
        Users persona modelling is a process of grouping different customers based on their behaviours, needs, goals and requirements.
        These groups are given an archetype persona (fictional character) that helps capture motivations, pain points, and preferences of the segment.
      </li>
      <li>
        The difficulty in creating good user personas is that different people in the organisation have different interactions with different clients
        and these perspectives need to be gathered and shared. This workshop captures those experiences to create a rounded set of user personas
        that represent the people you interact with.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Social media sentiment analysis
    <ul>
      <li>
        I utilise Transformers, Deep learning models and Natural Language Processing tools to setup a sentiment dashboard for your company.
      </li>
      <li>
        Training in understanding Consumer Trust Metrics
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Consumer Perception Management Planning
    <ul>
      <li>
        This is similar to risk management, but instead of identifying and mitigating financial or operational risks,
        it focuses on tracking, analysing, and influencing public sentiment about a brand, product, or company.
      </li>
      <li>
        Connect your qualified data (persona modelling workshop) with your quantified data (sentiment analysis)
      </li>
      <li>
        SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify potential crisis triggers (e.g., social media backlash, product failures, economic downturns)
      </li>
      <li>
        Examine industry trends for comparison and identification of early warning signs
      </li>
      <li>
        Crisis Prevention Planning (spotting negative trends early)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The outcomes of this package is not a marketing plan, or a PR plan, or a Product Development Plan.
  It’s a quantified understanding of your customers emotional dynamics that feeds into, and connects with,
  other planning activities in the organisation.

<h2>Realtime Facial and Posture Analysis Consultation</h2>
<p>Facial analysis is a powerful tool for understanding human emotions, intent, and engagement. posture analysis can work effectively for cameras monitoring multiple people. I provide expert consultation on integrating facial recognition and posture detection technologies for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Customer experience solutions</li>
  <li>Enhancing security</li>
  <li>Operator alertness/fatigue detection</li>
</ul>

<p>Facial analysis comes with significant ethical and privacy concerns. I can provide guidance on implementing these technologies responsibly, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and mitigating risks of bias in AI-driven facial recognition systems.</p>

<h2>Affective Display and HCI</h2>
<p>Affective computing transforms how humans interact with technology by enabling systems to recognise, interpret, and respond to emotional states. Whether you’re developing an AI companion, a robotic assistant, or an emotionally aware interface, I provide expertise in designing and implementing affective displays that enhance user engagement.</p>

<h3>What I Offer:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Multimodal Emotion Recognition</strong> – I help develop systems that combine facial recognition, voice tone analysis, physiological signals, and contextual cues to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of user emotions.</li>
  <li><strong>Emotionally Expressive AI and Robots</strong> – I consult on designing AI agents and robots that display emotions using facial expressions, voice modulation, body language, and visual cues.</li>
  <li><strong>Affective Feedback Loops</strong> – By incorporating real-time emotional feedback from users, AI systems can adjust their interactions, making them feel more intuitive, empathetic, and engaging.</li>
</ul>
