  <h1>Digital Signal Processing</h1>

  <h2>My Background</h2>
  <p>Draw on my extensive experience in signal acquisition and analysis acquired during my PHD and further work at various engineering firms and CSIRO, I am fairly familiar with processing the following signals: EKG, galvanic skin response, respiratory data, surface electromyography (sEMG), blood volume pole, Eddy Current Testing (ECT), capacitive sensors, accelerometers and MPU units, weather station data, and a large assortment of analogue devices.</p>
  
  <h2>What I Offer</h2>
  <p>I specialise in Digital Signal Processing (DSP), applying advanced techniques to extract meaningful insights from raw sensor data. My expertise bridges DSP, AI, and sensor technology, and embedded systems, allowing me to develop high-performance signal analysis systems.</p>
  
  <h3>Expertise in DSP & Signal Analysis</h3>
  <p>With a background in DSP from my PhD, work at CATER, and research at CSIRO, I have extensive experience in processing and analysing signals across multiple domains. My expertise includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Time-Series Analysis & Feature Extraction</strong> – Identifying key patterns in physiological, environmental, and industrial sensor data.</li>
    <li><strong>Fourier & Wavelet Transforms</strong> – Applying spectral analysis techniques for noise reduction, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptive Filtering & Noise Reduction</strong> – Using Kalman filters, Wiener filters, and AI-driven denoising models for real-time applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Multispectral & Hyperspectral Signal Processing</strong> – Extracting meaningful information from complex datasets for material analysis, remote sensing, and NDT applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning & AI in DSP</strong> – Integrating AI-driven techniques such automated feature extraction.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What I Don’t Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Military applications</li>
    <li>Music industry and audio engineering solutions</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Agtech firms</li>
    <li>Research institutions and R&D teams</li>
    <li>Industrial and scientific software developers</li>
    <li>AI and data science teams in scientific domains</li>
    <li>Engineering and modelling specialists</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Multi-disciplinary expertise – Combining DSP, AI, and sensor technology for powerful signal analysis solutions.</li>
    <li>Strong research & applied experience – Proven track record in academic research (PhD), agtech applications (CSIRO), and industry solutions (CATER).</li>
    <li>Custom DSP solutions – From research prototypes to real-world deployments, I build tailored, high-performance DSP systems.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If you need advanced DSP solutions that integrate AI, high-performance computing, and real-time analysis, let’s collaborate to develop intelligent signal processing systems that deliver real impact.</p>
