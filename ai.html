  <h1>AI, Predictive Modelling & Classifier Development</h1>

<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>Benefit from my strong foundation in machine learning, I have worked in the Australian National University, and CSIRO, designing AI-driven solutions for complex challenges—ranging from mineral classification, predictive maintenance and anomaly detection to advanced applications in agricultural and industrial domains. I also completed a PhD in using machine learning to detect human emotional states from physiological signal data.</p>

<h2>What I Offer</h2>
<p>I develop AI-driven solutions for predictive modelling, classifier development and computer vision. With expertise in Python, C++, CUDA, and deep learning frameworks, I create high-performance AI models tailored to complex scientific, industrial, and business applications.</p>

<h3>Expertise in AI & Predictive Modelling</h3>
<p>I have extensive experience across multiple domains, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Neural Networks & Deep Learning</strong> – Using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and CUDA-accelerated frameworks to design custom AI models for real-time applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Classical Machine Learning</strong> – Implementing algorithms such as SVMs, decision trees, kNN, and random forests for structured data classification and regression.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-Series & Anomaly Detection</strong> – Developing predictive maintenance systems, and fault detection algorithms, building upon my PhD research in biosignal processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Computer Vision-Based AI</strong> – Training object detection, segmentation, and feature extraction models for industrial automation and scientific research.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time & Embedded AI Solutions</strong> – Deploying machine learning models to edge devices, robotics, and embedded systems for on-device inference.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Custom Classifier Development</h3>
<p>I specialise in developing highly optimised classifiers that extract meaning from complex datasets. My services include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Feature Engineering & Selection</strong> – Identifying the most relevant data attributes to improve model accuracy and efficiency.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training & Tuning</strong> – Building and refining models to achieve high accuracy and reliability.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What I Don’t Do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Military applications</li>
  <li>Mining of covertly collected data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who I Work With</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Research institutions and R&D teams</li>
  <li>Industrial and scientific software developers</li>
  <li>AI and data science teams in scientific domains</li>
  <li>Engineering and modelling specialists</li>
  <li>Agtech firms</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
<p>I offer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hands-on expertise in AI, deep learning, and signal processing.</li>
  <li>Experience deploying AI on HPC clusters, embedded systems, and cloud environments.</li>
  <li>A pragmatic, results-driven approach focused on solving real-world problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need custom AI solutions, predictive modelling, or classifier development, let’s collaborate to build intelligent, data-driven systems that deliver measurable impact.</p>
